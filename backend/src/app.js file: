```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const userRoutes = require('./routes/user');

// Middleware
app.use(express.json());

// Routes
app.use('/users', userRoutes);

module.exports = app;
```

This code sets up the main application file that configures the Express server. It imports the `express` module and creates an instance of the Express application.

The `express.json()` middleware is used to parse the request body as JSON, allowing for easy access to the data sent in the request.

The code also imports the user routes from the `./routes/user` file and sets up the route handling by using the `app.use()` method. This means that any routes starting with "/users" will be handled by the user routes defined in `userRoutes`.

Finally, the `app` instance is exported to be used by other parts of the application.
